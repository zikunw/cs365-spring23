    "# Programming Assignment: Email Spam Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview/Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this programming assignment is to build a naive bayes classifier from scratch that can determine whether email text should be labled spam or not spam based on its contents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Remeber that a naive bayes classifier realizes the following probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Y|X_1,X_2,...,X_n) \\propto P(Y)*P(Y|X_1)*P(Y|X_2)*...*P(Y|X_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $Y$ is a binary class {0,1}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $X_i$ is a feature of the input\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier will decide what class each input belongs to based on highest probability from the equation above\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember that the classifier must be written from scratch; do NOT use any libraries that implement the classifier for you, such as but not limited to sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "You CAN, however, use SKlearn to split up the dataset between testing and training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to look up any tasks you are not familiar with, e.g. the function call to read a csv\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task list/Recommended Order\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide some guidance, I am giving the following order/checklist to solve this task:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>Compute the \"prior\": P(Y) for Y = 0 and Y = 1</li>\n",
    "  <li>Compute the \"likelihood\": $P(Y|X_n)$</li>\n",
    "  <li>Write code that uses the two items above to make a decision on whether or not an email is spam or ham (aka not spam)</li>\n",
    "  <li>Write code to evaluate your model. Test model on training data to debug </li>\n",
    "  <li>Test model on testing data to debug </li>\n",
